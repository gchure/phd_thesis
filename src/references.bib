  abstract = {Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-WymanChangeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.},

  abstract = {Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, Escherichia coli and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels that open and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In E. coli, one of the most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single-cell resolution using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conducted these experiments in an E. coli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL, whose expression was tuned across 3 orders of magnitude through modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes in osmotic pressure, we find that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are needed to convey upwards of 80\% survival. This number agrees with the average MscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies and quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observed zero survival events in cells with fewer than ϳ100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival, as well as regulation of their activity.},

  shorttitle = {From Protein Interactions to Functional Annotation},
  abstract = {Background: Sequence alignment is a prolific basis of functional annotation, but remains a challenging problem in the 'twilight zone' of high sequence divergence or short gene length. Here we demonstrate how information on gene interactions can help to resolve ambiguous sequence alignments. We compare two distant Herpes viruses by constructing a graph alignment, which is based jointly on the similarity of their protein interaction networks and on sequence similarity. This hybrid method provides functional associations between proteins of the two organisms that cannot be obtained from sequence or interaction data alone.
Results: We find proteins where interaction similarity and sequence similarity are individually weak, but together provide significant evidence of orthology. There are also proteins with high interaction similarity but without any detectable sequence similarity, providing evidence of functional association beyond sequence homology. The functional predictions derived from our alignment are consistent with genomic position and gene expression data.
Conclusion: Our approach shows that evolutionary conservation is a powerful filter to make protein interaction data informative about functional similarities between the interacting proteins, and it establishes graph alignment as a powerful tool for the comparative analysis of data from highly diverged species.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics driven out of equilibrium by growth, expansion or adaptation often generate a characteristically skewed distribution of descendant numbers: The earliest, the most advanced or the fittest ancestors have exceptionally large number of descendants, which Luria and Delbr{\"u}ck called ``jackpot" events. Here, I show that recurrent jackpot events generate a deterministic median bias favoring majority alleles, which is akin to positive frequency-dependent selection (proportional to the log-ratio of the frequencies of mutant and wild-type alleles). This fictitious selection force results from the fact that majority alleles tend to sample deeper into the tail of the descendant distribution. The flipside of this sampling effect is the rare occurrence of large frequency hikes in favor of minority alleles, which ensures that the allele frequency dynamics remains neutral in expectation, unless genuine selection is present. The resulting picture of a selection-like bias compensated by rare big jumps allows for an intuitive understanding of allele frequency trajectories and enables the exact calculation of transition densities for a range of important scenarios, including population size variations and different forms of natural selection. As a general signature of evolution by rare events, fictitious selection hampers the establishment of new beneficial mutations, counteracts balancing selection and confounds methods to infer selection from data over limited timescales.},

  abstract = {We present a macroscopic theory to characterize the plasticity, robustness, and evolvability of biological responses and their fluctuations. First, linear approximation in intracellular reaction dynamics is used to demonstrate proportional changes in the expression of all cellular components in response to a given environmental stress, with the proportion coefficient determined by the change in growth rate as a consequence of the steady growth of cells. We further demonstrate that this relationship is supported through adaptation experiments of bacteria, perhaps too well as this proportionality is held even across cultures of different types of conditions. On the basis of simulations of cell models, we further show that this global proportionality is a consequence of evolution in which expression changes in response to environmental or genetic perturbations are constrained along a unique one-dimensional curve, which is a result of evolutionary robustness. It then follows that the expression changes induced by environmental changes are proportionally reduced across different components of a cell by evolution, which is akin to the Le Chatelier thermodynamics principle. Finally, with the aid of a fluctuation-response relationship, this proportionality is shown to hold between fluctuations caused by genetic changes and those caused by noise. Overall, these results and support from the theoretical and experimental literature suggest a formulation of cellular systems akin to thermodynamics, in which a macroscopic potential is given by the growth rate (or fitness) represented as a function of environmental and evolutionary changes.},

  abstract = {Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.},

  abstract = {Bacteria residing within biofilm communities can coordinate their behavior through cell-to-cell signaling. However, it remains unclear if these signals can also influence the behavior of distant cells that are not part of the community. Using a microfluidic approach, we find that potassium ion channel-mediated electrical signaling generated by a Bacillus subtilis biofilm can attract distant cells. Integration of experiments and mathematical modeling indicates that extracellular potassium emitted from the biofilm alters the membrane potential of distant cells, thereby directing their motility. This electrically-mediated attraction appears to be a generic mechanism that enables cross-species interactions, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells also become attracted to the electrical signal released by the B. subtilis biofilm. Cells within a biofilm community can thus not only coordinate their own behavior, but also influence the behavior of diverse bacteria at a distance through long-range electrical signaling.},

Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of ``conditional neutrality'' in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.},

Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.},

  abstract = {Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number\textemdash{}in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities of the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design the output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Recent work indicates a general architecture for proteins in which sparse networks of physically contiguous and coevolving amino acids underlie basic aspects of structure and function. These networks, termed sectors, are spatially organized such that active sites are linked to many surface sites distributed throughout the structure. Using the metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase as a model system, we show that: (1) the sector is strongly correlated to a network of residues undergoing millisecond conformational fluctuations associated with enzyme catalysis, and (2) sector-connected surface sites are statistically preferred locations for the emergence of allosteric control in vivo. Thus, sectors represent an evolutionarily conserved ``wiring'' mechanism that can enable perturbations at specific surface positions to rapidly initiate conformational control over protein function. These findings suggest that sectors enable the evolution of intermolecular communication and regulation.},

LuxN, a nine-transmembrane domain protein from Vibrio harveyi, is the founding example of membrane-bound receptors for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of doseresponse curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified. We find that quorum-sensing-mediated communication can be manipulated positively and negatively to control bacterial behavior and, more broadly, that signaling parameters can be deduced from in vivo data.},

The first method employs the 30-exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase (T4 pol), Taq DNA polymerase (Taq pol), and Taq DNA ligase (Taq lig) in a two-step thermocycled reaction. The second method uses 30-exonuclease III (ExoIII), antibody-bound Taq pol, and Taq lig in a one-step thermocycled reaction. The third method employs 50-T5 exonuclease, Phusion{\`O} DNA polymerase, and Taq lig in a onestep isothermal reaction and can be used to assemble both ssDNA and dsDNA.

  abstract = {We have developed a protocol to assemble in one step and one tube at least nine separate DNA fragments together into an acceptor vector, with 90\% of recombinant clones obtained containing the desired construct. This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call `Golden Gate shuffling', is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene.},

The accessibility of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has transformed this study, enabling large-scale enumeration of fitness for many mutants and even complete sequence spaces in some cases. We review the progress of high-throughput studies in mapping molecular fitness landscapes, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as opportunities for future research.

  issn = {00928674},
  abstract = {Bacteria exhibit cell-to-cell variability in their resilience to stress, for example, following antibiotic exposure. Higher resilience is typically ascribed to ``dormant'' non-growing cellular states. Here, by measuring membrane potential dynamics of Bacillus subtilis cells, we show that actively growing bacteria can cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics through an alternative mechanism based on ion flux modulation. Specifically, we observed two types of cellular behavior: growth-defective cells exhibited a mathematically predicted transient increase in membrane potential (hyperpolarization), followed by cell death, whereas growing cells lacked hyperpolarization events and showed elevated survival. Using structural perturbations of the ribosome and proteomic analysis, we uncovered that stress resilience arises from magnesium influx, which prevents hyperpolarization. Thus, ion flux modulation provides a distinct mechanism to cope with ribosomal stress. These results suggest new approaches to increase the effectiveness of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and reveal an intriguing connection between ribosomes and the membrane potential, two fundamental properties of cells.},

  abstract = {Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.},

  abstract = {Bacteria residing within biofilm communities can coordinate their behavior through cell-to-cell signaling. However, it remains unclear if these signals can also influence the behavior of distant cells that are not part of the community. Using a microfluidic approach, we find that potassium ion channel-mediated electrical signaling generated by a Bacillus subtilis biofilm can attract distant cells. Integration of experiments and mathematical modeling indicates that extracellular potassium emitted from the biofilm alters the membrane potential of distant cells, thereby directing their motility. This electrically mediated attraction appears to be a generic mechanism that enables cross-species interactions, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells also become attracted to the electrical signal released by the B. subtilis biofilm. Cells within a biofilm community can thus not only coordinate their own behavior but also influence the behavior of diverse bacteria at a distance through long-range electrical signaling.},

  title = {Evolutionary Dynamics of Phage Resistance in Bacterial Biofilms},
  abstract = {Interactions among bacteria and their viral predators, the bacteriophages, are likely among the most common ecological phenomena on Earth. The constant threat of phage infection to bacterial hosts, and the imperative of achieving infection on the part of phages, drives an evolutionary contest in which phage-resistant bacteria emerge, often followed by phages with new routes of infection. This process has received abundant theoretical and experimental attention for decades and forms an important basis for molecular genetics and theoretical ecology and evolution. However, at present, we know very little about the nature of phage-bacteria interaction \textendash{} and the evolution of phage resistance \textendash{} inside the surface-bound communities that microbes usually occupy in natural environments. These communities, termed biofilms, are encased in a matrix of secreted polymers produced by their microbial residents. Biofilms are spatially constrained such that interactions become limited to neighbors or nearneighbors; diffusion of solutes and particulates is reduced; and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and therefore physiological state. These factors can dramatically impact the way phage infections proceed even in simple, single-strain biofilms, but we still know little of their effect on phage resistance evolutionary dynamics. Here we explore this problem using a computational simulation framework customized for implementing phage infection inside multi-strain biofilms. Our simulations predict that it is far easier for phage-susceptible and phageresistant bacteria to coexist inside biofilms relative to planktonic culture, where phages and hosts are well-mixed. We characterize the negative frequency dependent selection that underlies this coexistence, and we then test and confirm this prediction using an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy at single-cell and single-phage resolution.},

The predictive power of a model relies on accurate quantification of model parameters. Here, we illustrate challenges in parameter quantification and offer means to overcome these challenges, using a case example in which we quantitatively predict the growth rate of a cooperative community. Specifically, the community consists of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, each engineered to release a metabolite required and consumed by its partner. The initial model, employing parameters measured in batch monocultures with zero or excess metabolite, failed to quantitatively predict experimental results. To resolve the model\textendash{}experiment discrepancy, we chemically identified the correct exchanged metabolites, but this did not improve model performance. We then remeasured strain phenotypes in chemostats mimicking the metabolite-limited community environments, while mitigating or incorporating effects of rapid evolution. Almost all phenotypes we measured, including death rate, metabolite release rate, and the amount of metabolite consumed per cell birth, varied significantly with the metabolite environment. Once we used parameters measured in a range of community-like chemostat environments, prediction quantitatively agreed with experimental results. In summary, using a simplified community, we uncovered and devised means to resolve modeling challenges that are likely general to living systems.},

  title = {Virtual {{Microbes}} Evolve Multiple Mechanisms to the Same End: Anticipating a Serial Transfer Protocol},
  shorttitle = {Virtual {{Microbes}} Evolve Multiple Mechanisms to the Same End},
  abstract = {Background: Experimental evolution of microbes often involves a serial transfer protocol, where microbes are repeatedly diluted by transfer to a fresh medium, starting a new growth cycle. This protocol has revealed that evolution can be remarkably reproducible, where microbes show parallel adaptations both on the level of the phenotype as well as the genotype. However, these studies also reveal a strong potential for divergent evolution, leading to diversity both between and within replicate populations. We here study how in silico evolved Virtual Microbe ``wild types'' (WTs) adapt to a serial transfer protocol to investigate both the generic evolutionary adaptation to such an environment which are independent of prior evolution, and the variety of ways in which the adaptation is implemented at the individual and ecosystem level.
Results: We show that all pre-evolved WTs evolve to anticipate the regularity of the serial transfer protocol by adopting a fine-tuned balance of growth and survival. We find that this anticipation can be done in a variety of ways, either by a single lineage or by several lineages in consort. Interestingly, replicate populations of the same WT initially show similar trajectories, but may subsequently diverge along a growth rate versus yield trade-off.
Conclusions: We find that all our in silico WTs show the same anticipation effects \textemdash{} fitting the periodicity of a serial transfer protocol \textemdash{} but do so by a variety of mechanisms. Our results reveal new insights into the dynamics and relevant selection pressures in experimental evolution, but also highlight how, in an eco-evolutionary context, numerous mechanisms can evolve to the same end.},

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over repeated rounds of subculture with immigration. Consistent with theory, we find a transition exists between neutral and selective regimes, and the crossover point depends on the fraction of immigrants and the magnitude of fitness differences. Neutral models predict an increase in diversity with increased carrying capacity, while our selective model predicts a decrease in diversity. The community here lost diversity with an increase in carrying capacity, highlighting that using the correct model is essential for predicting community response to change. Together, these results emphasize the importance of including selection to obtain realistic models of even simple systems.},

  abstract = {Polymicrobial interactions play an important role in shaping the outcome of antibiotic treatment, yet how multispecies communities respond to antibiotic assault is still little understood. Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.},

It is therefore important to quantitatively understand how spatial proximity affects interactions in different environments. We tested how proximity influences colony size when either Escherichia coli or Salmonella enterica are grown on various carbon sources. The importance of colony location changed with species and carbon source. Spatially explicit, genome-scale metabolic modeling recapitulated observed colony size variation. Competitors that determine territory size, according to Voronoi diagrams, were the most important drivers of variation in colony size. However, the relative importance of different competitors changed through time. Further, the effect of location increased when colonies took up resources quickly relative to the diffusion of limiting resources. These analyses made it apparent that the importance of location was smaller than expected for experiments with S. enterica growing on glucose. The accumulation of toxic byproducts appeared to limit the growth of large colonies and reduced variation in colony size. Our work provides an experimentally and theoretically grounded understanding of how location interacts with metabolism and diffusion to influence microbial interactions.},

Ptashne, Procx NatL Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76, 5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and PRM that control transcription of genes coding for the regulatory proteins cro and repressor, respectively. At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at Pn is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active. The results demonstrate the importance of cooperative interactions between repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator sites OR' and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic state and in allowing efficient switchover to the lytic state during induction.},

We then apply this model to characterize existing data on enzyme activity, comment on how enzyme parameters (such as substrate binding affinity) can be experimentally tuned, and make novel predictions on how to control phenomena such as substrate inhibition.},

We derive simple analytic formulas for key functional properties such as the leakiness, dynamic range, half-maximal effective concentration ([EC50]), and effective Hill coefficient, and explore the full spectrum of phenotypes that are accessible through mutations. Specifically, we consider mutations in the channel pore of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and the ligand binding domain of a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel, demonstrating how each mutation can be characterized as only affecting a subset of the biophysical parameters. In addition, we show how the unifying perspective offered by the MWC model allows us, perhaps surprisingly, to collapse the plethora of dose-response data from different classes of ion channels into a universal family of curves.},

Nonetheless, there is an Achilles' heel exposed by all of the genomic data that has accrued: We still do not know how to interpret them. Many genes are subject to sophisticated programs of transcriptional regulation, mediated by DNA sequences that harbor binding sites for transcription factors, which can up- or down-regulate gene expression depending upon environmental conditions. This gives rise to an input\textendash{}output function describing how the level of expression depends upon the parameters of the regulated gene\textemdash{}for instance, on the number and type of binding sites in its regulatory sequence. In recent years, the ability to make precision measurements of expression, coupled with the ability to make increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions, has enabled an explicit dialogue between theory and experiment that holds the promise of covering this genomic Achilles' heel. The goal is to reach a predictive understanding of transcriptional regulation that makes it possible to calculate gene expression levels from DNA regulatory sequence. This review focuses on the canonical simple repression motif to ask how well the models that have been used to characterize it actually work. We consider a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated experiments in which the minimal parameter set learned at one level is applied to make quantitative predictions at the next. We show that these careful quantitative dissections provide a template for a predictive understanding of the many more complex regulatory arrangements found across all domains of life.},

Our algorithm works for arbitrarily sized data sets and handles consistently any missing measurements.

The new switch has a repressor with altered headpiece domains for operator recognition and a redesigned dimer interface to create a heterodimeric repressor. Quite unexpectedly, the heterodimeric switch functions better than the natural system. It can repress more tightly than the naturally occurring switch of the lac operon; it is less leaky and can be induced more efficiently.

The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

These tetramers were used in binding studies to probe the relationship of the NH2 terminus and core domains in operator DNA binding and to explore subunit participation in both operator and nonspecific DNA binding. The purity of each tetramer was demonstrated by several lines of evidence, including physical characterization and measurement of the binding activities of the hybrid tetramer preparations. Each tetramer displayed measurable operator binding activity, and the dissociation constants of the tetramers for lambdaplac DNA and a 29 base operator fragment increase with the loss of each NH2 terminus. These studies strongly suggest that each NH2 terminus of the repressor interacts with the operator DNA, although the four NH2 termini do not appear to make equal contacts. The contributions of the NH2 terminus to operator binding do no appear to be identical with those for nonspecific DNA binding. In addition, the binding of the NH2 termini to nonspecific DNA can be described by postulating four identical, noninteracting sites. Although the rate of dissociation of the repressor-operator is increased by a factor of 2 upon removal of each NH2 terminus, calculations using the measured dissociation rate and equilibrium dissociation constant indicate that the rate of association of repressor to operator is decreased approximately 5-fold. These data suggest that the contacts made by the NH2 termini may greatly facilitate association with DNA. Competition studies of nonspecific DNA with operator DNA binding confirm the existence of two operator DNA binding sites on each tetramer and suggest that the contacts of a single NH2 terminus are not identical for the two operator binding sites.},

However, alterations in the Stern-Volmer constants for iodide quenching of the tryptophans in the mutant proteins compared to wild-type suggest differences in the local environment or solvent accessibility for these amino acids in the tight-binding repressors. The inducer-binding affinities and association rate constants of the mutant proteins and protein-operator DNA fragment complexes are also altered compared to wild-type. The extents of these changes vary among the different mutant repressors. The nonspecific DNA-binding affinities of the mutant proteins are 2--3-fold greater than the wild-type repressor, and the affinities of the tight-binding proteins for a 29 base-pair operator DNA fragment are also increased, though to a varying extent depending upon the mutant. The phenotypic behavior of these proteins in vivo can be partially explained by these results obtained in vitro; however, it is likely that there are additional factors responsible for the tight-binding behavior of the proteins that were not detectable in these experiments.},

  abstract = {Protein structural change underlies many signal transduction processes. Although end-state structures are known for various allosteric proteins, intermediates are difficult to observe. Recently, targeted molecular dynamics simulation (TMD) was used to examine the conformational transition and predict relevant intermediates for wild-type lactose repressor (LacI). A catalog of involved residues suggests that the transition of this homodimer is asymmetric and that K84 is a prominent participant in the dynamic N-subdomain interface. Previous experiments indicated that hydrophobic substitutions at position 84 engender slowed, biphasic inducer binding kinetics, which might reflect the same phenomena observed in TMD. Here, we report biochemical confirmation that DNA and inducer binding remain allosterically linked in K84A and K84L, albeit with a differential smaller than that found in wild-type LacI. Other features of these mutant proteins are consistent with an allosteric conformational shift that approximates that of the wild type. As a consequence, these repressors can be utilized to explore an unanswered question about LacI function: How many inducers (one or two per dimer) are required to diminish operator affinity? The biphasic natures of the K84L and K84A inducer association rates allow direct correlation between the two distinct inducer binding events and operator release. Indeed, the kinetics of operator release for the K84A and K84L closely parallel those for the second inducer binding event. Together with implications from previous equilibrium results for wild-type and mutant proteins, these kinetic data demonstrate that binding of two inducers per dimeric DNA binding unit is required to release the operator in these variant LacI proteins.},

The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms.

Biofilms are associated with biotic and abiotic surfaces and are composed of aggregates of cells that are encased by a self-produced or acquired extracellular matrix. Vibrio cholerae has been studied as a model organism for understanding biofilm formation in environmental pathogens, as it spends much of its life cycle outside of the human host in the aquatic environment. Given the important role of biofilm formation in the V. cholerae life cycle, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and the signals that trigger biofilm assembly or dispersal have been areas of intense investigation over the past 20 years. In this Review, we discuss V. cholerae surface attachment, various matrix components and the regulatory networks controlling biofilm formation.},

  abstract = {Clonal interference, the competition between lineages arising from different beneficial mutations in an asexually reproducing population, is an important factor determining the tempo and mode of microbial adaptation. The standard theory of this phenomenon neglects the occurrence of multiple mutations as well as the correlation between loss by genetic drift and clonal competition, which is questionable in large populations. Working within the Wright\textendash{}Fisher model with multiplicative fitness (no epistasis), we determine the rate of adaptation asymptotically for very large population sizes and show that the standard theory fails in this regime. Our study also explains the success of the standard theory in predicting the rate of adaptation for moderately large populations. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the substitution process changes qualitatively when multiple mutations are allowed for, because several mutations can be fixed in a single fixation event. As a consequence, the index of dispersion for counts of the fixation process displays a minimum as a function of population size, whereas the origination process of fixed mutations becomes completely regular for very large populations. We find that the number of mutations fixed in a single event is geometrically distributed as in the neutral case. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations combined with analytic results for the limit of infinite population size.},

  volume = {10},

  abstract = {Mutation accumulation experiments followed by whole-genome sequencing have revealed that, for several bacterial species, the rate of base-pair substitutions (BPSs) is not constant across the chromosome but varies in a wave-like pattern that is symmetrical about the origin of replication. The experiments reported here demonstrated that, in Escherichia coli, several interacting factors determine the wave. The origin is a major driver of BPS rates. When it is relocated, the BPS rates in a 1,000-kb region surrounding the new origin reproduce the pattern that surrounds the normal origin. However, the pattern across distant regions of the chromosome is unaltered and thus must be determined by other factors. Increasing the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentration shifts the wave pattern away from the origin, supporting the hypothesis that fluctuations in dNTP pools coincident with replication firing contribute to the variations in the mutation rate. The nucleoid binding proteins (HU and Fis) and the terminus organizing protein (MatP) are also major factors. These proteins alter the three-dimensional structure of the DNA, and results suggest that mutation rates increase when highly structured DNA is replicated. Biases in error correction by proofreading and mismatch repair, both of which may be responsive to dNTP concentrations and DNA structure, also are major determinants of the wave pattern. These factors should apply to most bacterial and, possibly, eukaryotic genomes and suggest that different areas of the genome evolve at different rates.},

The dynamics of adaptation depend on the underlying fitness landscape. Virtually nothing is known about fitness landscapes in nature, and few methods allow us to infer the landscape from empirical data. With a view toward this inference problem, we have developed a theory that, in the weak-mutation limit, predicts how a population's mean fitness and the number of accumulated substitutions are expected to increase over time, depending on the underlying fitness landscape. We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations. We introduce a scheme that classifies landscapes in terms of the qualitative evolutionary dynamics they produce. We show that linear substitution trajectories, long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution, can arise even when mutations are strongly selected. Our results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism's fitness landscape from temporal data. Applying these methods to data from a long-term experiment, we infer the sign and strength of epistasis among beneficial mutations in the Escherichia coli genome.

  abstract = {Abstract How can changes in growth rate affect the regulatory networks behavior and the outcomes of cellular differentiation? We address this question by focusing on starvation response in sporulating Bacillus subtilis. We show that the activity of sporulation master regulator Spo0A increases with decreasing cellular growth rate. Using a mathematical model of the phosphorelay?the network controlling Spo0A?we predict that this increase in Spo0A activity can be explained by the phosphorelay protein accumulation and lengthening of the period between chromosomal replication events caused by growth slowdown. As a result, only cells growing slower than a certain rate reach threshold Spo0A activity necessary for sporulation. This growth threshold model accurately predicts cell fates and explains the distribution of sporulation deferral times. We confirm our predictions experimentally and show that the concentration rather than activity of phosphorelay proteins is affected by the growth slowdown. We conclude that sensing the growth rates enables cells to indirectly detect starvation without the need for evaluating specific stress signals.},

Tracking mutant clones with a tunable fitness effect in bacterial colonies grown on randomly patterned surfaces we found that environmental heterogeneity can dramatically reduce the efficacy of selection. Time-lapse microscopy and computer simulations suggest that this effect arises generically from a local 'pinning' of the expansion front, whereby stretches of the front are slowed down on a length scale that depends on the structure of the environmental heterogeneity. This pinning focuses the range expansion into a small number of 'lucky' individuals with access to expansion paths, altering the neutral evolutionary dynamics and increasing the importance of chance relative to selection.},

We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation.

The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus.

  abstract = {Bacteria are subjected to a host of different environmental stresses. One such insult occurs when cells encounter changes in the osmolarity of the surrounding media resulting in an osmotic shock. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about mechanosensitive (MS) channels which are thought to provide osmoprotection in these circumstances by opening emergency release valves in response to membrane tension. However, even the most elementary physiological parameters such as the number of MS channels per cell, how MS channel expression levels influence the physiological response of the cells, and how this mean number of channels varies from cell to cell remain unanswered. In this paper, we make a detailed quantitative study of the expression of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) in different media and at various stages in the growth history of bacterial cultures. Using both quantitative fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Western blots our study complements earlier electrophysiology-based estimates and results in the following key insights: i) the mean number of channels per cell is much higher than previously estimated, ii) measurement of the single-cell distributions of such channels reveals marked variability from cell to cell and iii) the mean number of channels varies under different environmental conditions. The regulation of MscL expression displays rich behaviors that depend strongly on culturing conditions and stress factors, which may give clues to the physiological role of MscL. The number of stressinduced MscL channels and the associated variability have far reaching implications for the in vivo response of the channels and for modeling of this response. As shown by numerous biophysical models, both the number of such channels and their variability can impact many physiological processes including osmoprotection, channel gating probability, and channel clustering.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter PR in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.

  title = {Detecting Genetic Interactions Using Parallel Evolution in Experimental Populations},
  volume = {374},
  abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes contain thousands of genes organized into complex and interconnected genetic interaction networks. Most of our understanding of how genetic variation affects these networks comes from quantitative-trait loci mapping and from the systematic analysis of double-deletion (or knockdown) mutants, primarily in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evolve and re-sequence experiments are an alternative approach for identifying novel functional variants and genetic interactions, particularly between non-loss-of-function mutations. These experiments leverage natural selection to obtain genotypes with functionally important variants and positive genetic interactions. However, no systematic methods for detecting genetic interactions in these data are yet available. Here, we introduce a computational method based on the idea that variants in genes that interact will co-occur in evolved genotypes more often than expected by chance. We apply this method to a previously published yeast experimental evolution dataset. We find that genetic targets of selection are distributed non-uniformly among evolved genotypes, indicating that genetic interactions had a significant effect on evolutionary trajectories. We identify individual gene pairs with a statistically significant genetic interaction score. The strongest interaction is between genes TRK1 and PHO84, genes that have not been reported to interact in previous systematic studies. Our work demonstrates that leveraging parallelism in experimental evolution is useful for identifying genetic interactions that have escaped detection by other methods.This article is part of the theme issue `Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions'.},

Recently, microfluidic systems that incorporate shear force and very small volumes have been developed to provide cell biology models that resemble in vivo conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if the BioFlux 200 microfluidic system could be used to study host-pathogen interactions and biofilm formation by pathogenic Escherichia coli. Strains of various pathotypes were selected to establish the growth conditions for the formation of biofilms in the BioFlux 200 system on abiotic (glass) or biotic (eukaryotic-cell) surfaces. Biofilm formation on glass was observed for the majority of strains when they were grown in M9 medium at 30\textdegree{}C but not in RPMI medium at 37\textdegree{}C. In contrast, HRT-18 cell monolayers enhanced binding and, in most cases, biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli in RPMI medium at 37\textdegree{}C. As a proof of principle, the biofilm-forming ability of a diffusely adherent E. coli mutant strain lacking AIDA-I, a known mediator of attachment, was assessed in our models. In contrast to the parental strain, which formed a strong biofilm, the mutant formed a thin biofilm on glass or isolated clusters on HRT-18 monolayers. In conclusion, we describe a microfluidic method for high-throughput screening that could be used to identify novel factors involved in E. coli biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions under shear force.},

SuperSegger incorporates machine-learning algorithms to optimize cellular boundaries and automated error resolution to reliably link cells from frame-to-frame. Unlike existing packages, it can reliably segment microcolonies with many cells, facilitating the analysis of cell-cycle dynamics in bacteria as well as cell-contact mediated phenomena. This package has a range of built-in capabilities for characterizing bacterial cells, including the identification of cell division events, mother, daughter and neighbouring cells, and computing statistics on cellular fluorescence, the location and intensity of fluorescent foci. SuperSegger provides a variety of postprocessing data visualization tools for single cell and population level analysis, such as histograms, kymographs, frame mosaics, movies and consensus images. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the package by analyzing lag phase growth with single cell resolution.},

For a growing population of biological cells, for example, the population's growth rate is typically more important than its size. Here we introduce a non-parametric method to infer first and second time derivatives as a function of time from time-series data. Our approach is based on Gaussian processes and applies to a wide range of data. In tests, the method is at least as accurate as others, but has several advantages: it estimates errors both in the inference and in any summary statistics, such as lag times, and allows interpolation with the corresponding error estimation. As illustrations, we infer growth rates of microbial cells, the rate of assembly of an amyloid fibril and both the speed and acceleration of two separating spindle pole bodies. Our algorithm should thus be broadly applicable.},

In Drosophila, population-genetic studies have revealed substantial adaptive evolution at the genomic level, but the evolutionary modes of gene expression remain controversial. Here, we present evidence that adaptation dominates the evolution of gene expression levels in flies. We show that 64\% of the observed expression divergence across seven Drosophila species are adaptive changes driven by directional selection. Our results are derived from time-resolved data of gene expression divergence across a family of related species, using a probabilistic inference method for gene-specific selection. Adaptive gene expression is stronger in specific functional classes, including regulation, sensory perception, sexual behavior, and morphology. Moreover, we identify a large group of genes with sex-specific adaptation of expression, which predominantly occurs in males. Our analysis opens an avenue to map system-wide selection on molecular quantitative traits independently of their genetic basis.},

  title = {Genetic Drift in Range Expansions Is Very Sensitive to Density Feedback in Dispersal and Growth},
  abstract = {Abstract: Theory predicts rapid genetic drift in expanding populations due to the serial founder effect at the expansion front. Yet, many natural populations maintain high genetic diversity in the newly colonized regions. Here, we investigate whether density-dependent dispersal could provide a resolution of this paradox. We find that genetic drift is dramatically suppressed when dispersal rates increase with the population density because many more migrants from the diverse, highdensity regions arrive at the expansion edge. When density-dependence is weak or negative, the effective population size of the front scales only logarithmically with the carrying capacity. The dependence, however, switches to a sublinear power law and then to a linear increase as the density-dependence becomes strongly positive. To understand these results, we introduce a unified framework that predicts how the strength of genetic drift depends on the densitydependence in both dispersal and growth. This theory reveals that the transitions between different regimes of diversity loss are controlled by a single, universal parameter: the ratio of the expansion velocity to the geometric mean of dispersal and growth rates at expansion edge. Importantly, our results suggest that positive density-dependence could dramatically alter evolution in expanding populations even when its contributions to the expansion velocity is small.},

  title = {Environmental Heterogeneity Can Tip the Population Genetics of Range Expansions},
  volume = {8},
  issn = {2050-084X},
  abstract = {The population genetics of most range expansions is thought to be shaped by the competition between Darwinian selection and random genetic drift at the range margins. Here, we show that the evolutionary dynamics during range expansions is highly sensitive to additional fluctuations induced by environmental heterogeneities. Tracking mutant clones with a tunable fitness effect in bacterial colonies grown on randomly patterned surfaces we found that environmental heterogeneity can dramatically reduce the efficacy of selection. Time-lapse microscopy and computer simulations suggest that this effect arises generically from a local 'pinning' of the expansion front, whereby stretches of the front are slowed down on a length scale that depends on the structure of the environmental heterogeneity. This pinning focuses the range expansion into a small number of 'lucky' individuals with access to expansion paths, altering the neutral evolutionary dynamics and increasing the importance of chance relative to selection.
          , 
            Throughout evolution, countless populations have expanded their territories by invading new areas. This invasion can happen on the scale of kilometers and millennia \textendash{} such as when humans migrated out of Africa \textendash{} or millimeters and months, such as the growth of a population of cells in a solid tumor. During this expansion, mutations can occur that can either increase or decrease fitness in the new territory. If a favorable mutation occurs at the edge of the population, then it has plenty of room to expand. Such a mutation has a high chance of becoming established, and so it can have a very strong impact on the genetic makeup of the population. This increase in evolutionary advantage in individuals at the front is called ``gene surfing''.
            This phenomenon is well known in populations living in ``homogeneous'' territories, where the new space a population is invading is more or less the same as the one they already occupy \textendash{} think of the endless flat grasslands of the Siberian steppes. But in reality, many territories are not like that. What happens if the new territory is not completely homogeneous? For instance, if a species' expansion is impeded by a mountain range with a series of valleys.
            Gralka and Hallatschek investigated how such changes in landscape could affect phenomena like gene surfing. Experiments using E. coli as a model system and computer simulations showed that a varied environment \textendash{} such as roughness akin to a mountain range and valleys, but on a bacterial scale \textendash{} had a strong influence on the fate of mutations arising in a population. Whether the environment is favorable for expansion or not in the place where the mutation happens becomes much more important than how the mutation itself affects fitness. So, if a beneficial mutation occurs at a cliff-edge, it is not likely to get far. But if it happens at a population edge by the bacterial equivalent of gently rolling hills, there is a much better chance of the mutation taking hold.
            The findings suggest that the amount a population can adapt during expansion is limited, and it can even lead to the spread of harmful mutations in a population if they occur in just the right spot. Piecing together these scenarios is important in order to accurately infer the evolutionary history of a species based on mutations present in its genome now. This type of knowledge can also be useful in developing new treatments for cancers, making use of these evolutionary processes to slow or halt a tumor's expansion.},

  abstract = {Purine repressor (PurR) binding to specific DNA is enhanced by complexing with purines, whereas lactose repressor (LacI) binding is diminished by interaction with inducer sugars despite 30\% identity in their protein sequences and highly homologous tertiary structures. Nonetheless, in switching from low- to high-affinity DNA binding, these proteins undergo a similar structural change in which the hinge region connecting the DNA and effector binding domains folds into an R-helix and contacts the DNA minor groove. The differences in response to effector for these proteins should be manifest in the polyelectrolyte effect which arises from cations displaced from DNA by interaction with positively charged side chains on a protein and is quantitated by measurement of DNA binding affinity as a function of ion concentration. Consistent with structural data for these proteins, high-affinity operator DNA binding by the PurR,purine complex involved {$\sim$}15 ion pairs, a value significantly greater than that for the corresponding state of LacI ({$\sim$}6 ion pairs). For both proteins, however, conversion to the low-affinity state results in a decrease of {$\sim$}2-fold in the number of cations released per dimeric DNA binding site. Heat capacity changes ({$\increment$}Cp) that accompany DNA binding, derived from buried apolar surface area, coupled folding, and restriction of motional freedom of polar groups in the interface, also reflect the differences between these homologous repressor proteins. DNA binding of the PurR,guanine complex is accompanied by a {$\increment$}Cp (-2.8 kcal mol-1 K-1) more negative than that observed previously for LacI (-0.9 to -1.5 kcal mol-1 K-1), suggesting that more extensive protein folding and/or enhanced structural rigidity may occur upon DNA binding for PurR compared to DNA binding for LacI. The differences between these proteins illustrate plasticity of function despite high-level sequence and structural homology and undermine efforts to predict protein behavior on the basis of such similarities.},

  abstract = {Bacterial physiology is a branch of biology that aims to understand overarching principles of cellular reproduction. Many important issues in bacterial physiology are inherently quantitative, and major contributors to the field have often brought together tools and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. This article presents a comprehensive overview of major ideas and approaches developed since the early 20th century for anyone who is interested in the fundamental problems in bacterial physiology. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part (sections 1\textendash{}3), we review the first `golden era' of bacterial physiology from the 1940s to early 1970s and provide a complete list of major references from that period. In the second part (sections 4\textendash{}7), we explain how the pioneering work from the first golden era has influenced various rediscoveries of general quantitative principles and significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically, section 4 presents the history and current progress of the `adder' principle of cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarsegraining the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome `sectors' re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final section 8, we conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.},

The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

  abstract = {Bacterial conglomerates such as biofilms and microcolonies are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in industry and medicine. In contrast to well-mixed cultures routinely used in microbial research, bacteria in a microcolony interact mechanically with one another and with the substrate to which they are attached. Here, we use a computer model of a microbial colony of rod-shaped cells to investigate how physical interactions between cells determine their motion in the colony and how this affects biological evolution. We show that the probability that a faster-growing mutant `surfs' at the colony's frontier and creates a macroscopic sector depends on physical properties of cells (shape, elasticity and friction). Although all these factors contribute to the surfing probability in seemingly different ways, their effects can be summarized by two summary statistics that characterize the front roughness and cell alignment. Our predictions are confirmed by experiments in which we measure the surfing probability for colonies of different front roughness. Our results show that physical interactions between bacterial cells play an important role in biological evolution of new traits, and suggest that these interactions may be relevant to processes such as de novo evolution of antibiotic resistance.},

Examples include the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked invasions.},

  abstract = {In the stationary phase, Bacillus subtilis differentiates stochastically and transiently into the state of competence for transformation (K-state). The latter is associated with growth arrest, and it is unclear how the ability to develop competence is stably maintained, despite its cost. To quantify the effect differentiation has on the competitive fitness of B. subtilis, we characterized the competition dynamics between strains with different probabilities of entering the K-state. The relative fitness decreased with increasing differentiation probability both during the stationary phase and during outgrowth. When exposed to antibiotics inhibiting cell wall synthesis, transcription, and translation, cells that differentiated into the K-state showed a selective advantage compared to differentiation-deficient bacteria; this benefit did not require transformation. Although beneficial, the K-state was not induced by sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics. Increasing the differentiation probability beyond the wt level did not significantly affect the competition dynamics with transient antibiotic exposure. We conclude that the competition dynamics are very sensitive to the fraction of competent cells under benign conditions but less sensitive during antibiotic exposure, supporting the picture of stochastic differentiation as a fitness trade-off.},

  abstract = {Many cellular populations are tightly packed, such as microbial colonies and biofilms, or tissues and tumours in multicellular organisms. The movement of one cell in these crowded assemblages requires motion of others, so that cell displacements are correlated over many cell diameters. Whenever movement is important for survival or growth, these correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. However, little is known about the interplay between mechanical forces and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking slower-growing clones at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that the collective motion of cells prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighbouring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. This mechanical screening of fitness differences allows slower-growing mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue. Our work suggests that, in crowded populations, cells cooperate with surrounding neighbours through inevitable mechanical interactions. This effect has to be considered when predicting evolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of drug resistance or cancer evolution. Slower-growing yeast clones at the colony edge have their fitness disadvantage masked by the collective motion of neighbouring cells, reducing the rate at which costly mutations are selected against.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Developing lymphocytes in the immune system of jawed vertebrates assemble antigen-receptor genes by undergoing large-scale reorganization of spatially separated V, D, and J gene segments through a process known as V(D)J recombination. The RAG protein initiates this process by binding and cutting recombination signal sequences (RSSs) composed of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences flanking less well-conserved 12- or 23-bp spacers. Little quantitative information is known about the contributions of individual RSS positions over the course of the RAG-RSS interaction. We employ a single-molecule method known as tethered particle motion to quantify the formation, stability, and cleavage of the RAG-12RSS-23RSS paired complex (PC) for numerous synthetic and endogenous 12RSSs. We thoroughly investigate the sequence space around a RSS by making 40 different single-bp changes and characterizing the reaction dynamics. We reveal that single-bp changes affect RAG function based on their position: loss of cleavage function (first three positions of the heptamer); reduced propensity for forming the PC (the nonamer and last four bp of the heptamer); or variable effects on PC formation (spacer). We find that the rare usage of some endogenous gene segments can be mapped directly to their adjacent 12RSSs to which RAG binds weakly. The 12RSS, however, cannot explain the high-frequency usage of other gene segments. Finally, we find that RSS nicking, while not required for PC formation, substantially stabilizes the PC. Our findings provide detailed insights into the contribution of individual RSS positions to steps of the RAG-RSS reaction that previously have been difficult to assess quantitatively.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While fundamental differences have been identified in the growth habit and chromosome structure of E. coli and Streptomyces, little is known about these regulatory mechanisms in filamentous bacteria. This paper reports on the relationship between the macromolecule content of S. coelicolor A3(2) and its specific growth rate. The protein, RNA and DNA contents (g per 100 g biomass) of S. coelicolor A3(2) grown in steady-state continuous culture over a range of specific growth rates (0.025-0.3 h-1) were 31-45, 10-22 and 3.5-4.5\% (w/w), respectively. This composition is qualitatively similar to that of other microorganisms. Changes in the macromolecular content of S. coelicolor A3(2) and E. coli B/r with specific growth rate appear to be essentially similar. However, the data indicate that the RNA content of S. coelicolor A3(2), grown under the conditions used, exceeds that of E. coli grown at the same specific growth rate. The data also suggest that overlapping rounds of replication are not a feature of DNA synthesis in S. coelicolor A3(2). This may be a function of the organism\&apos;s low maximum specific growth rate. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of regulatory mechanisms which act to inhibit the initiation of DNA synthesis in a linear chromosome which is already undergoing replication.,},

  abstract = {By exploring global gene expression of Escherichia coli growing on six different carbon sources, we discovered a striking genome transcription pattern: as carbon substrate quality declines, cells systematically increase the number of genes expressed. Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms1,2,3 and they remain a topic of active investigation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Although much is known about the molecular interactions that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied perturbations12,13,14,15,16,17, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently established coarse-grained proteome allocation models15,18,19,20 from steady-state growth into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts) without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation, which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.},

It is able to carry out strand exchange at one of the two cleavage sites of the FLP recognition target site (FRT site), but is defective in strand exchange at the other cleavage site.

Perhaps surprisingly, one of the theoretical tools that has been used with great success on problems ranging from how cells communicate with their environment and each other to the nature of the organization of proteins and lipids within the cell membrane is statistical mechanics. A knee-jerk reaction to the use of statistical mechanics in the description of cellular processes is that living organisms are so far from equilibrium that one has no business even thinking about it. But such reactions are probably too hasty given that there are many regimes in which, because of a separation of timescales, for example, such an approach can be a useful first step. In this article, we explore the power of statistical mechanical thinking in the biological setting, with special emphasis on cell signaling and regulation. We show how such models are used to make predictions and describe some recent experiments designed to test them.

  abstract = {Background
Glycerol has enhanced its biotechnological importance since it is a byproduct of biodiesel synthesis. A study of Escherichia coli physiology during growth on glycerol was performed combining transcriptional-proteomic analysis as well as kinetic and stoichiometric evaluations in the strain JM101 and certain derivatives with important inactivated genes.

Results
Transcriptional and proteomic analysis of metabolic central genes of strain JM101 growing on glycerol, revealed important changes not only in the synthesis of MglB, LamB and MalE proteins, but also in the overexpression of carbon scavenging genes: lamB, malE, mglB, mglC, galP and glk and some members of the RpoS regulon (pfkA, pfkB, fbaA, fbaB, pgi, poxB, acs, actP and acnA). Inactivation of rpoS had an important effect on stoichiometric parameters and growth adaptation on glycerol. The observed overexpression of poxB, pta, acs genes, glyoxylate shunt genes (aceA, aceB, glcB and glcC) and actP, suggested a possible carbon flux deviation into the PoxB, Acs and glyoxylate shunt. In this scenario acetate synthesized from pyruvate with PoxB was apparently reutilized via Acs and the glyoxylate shunt enzymes. In agreement, no acetate was detected when growing on glycerol, this strain was also capable of glycerol and acetate coutilization when growing in mineral media and derivatives carrying inactivated poxB or pckA genes, accumulated acetate. Tryptophanase A (TnaA) was synthesized at high levels and indole was produced by this enzyme, in strain JM101 growing on glycerol. Additionally, in the isogenic derivative with the inactivated tnaA gene, no indole was detected and acetate and lactate were accumulated. A high efficiency aromatic compounds production capability was detected in JM101 carrying pJLBaroGfbrtktA, when growing on glycerol, as compared to glucose.

Conclusions
The overexpression of several carbon scavenging, acetate metabolism genes and the absence of acetate accumulation occurred in JM101 cultures growing on glycerol. To explain these results it is proposed that in addition to the glycolytic metabolism, a gluconeogenic carbon recycling process that involves acetate is occurring simultaneously in this strain when growing on glycerol. Carbon flux from glycerol can be efficiently redirected in JM101 strain into the aromatic pathway using appropriate tools.},

  abstract = {Complex biological systems are very robust to genetic and environmental changes at all levels of organization. Many biological functions of Escherichia coli metabolism can be sustained against single-gene or even multiple-gene mutations by using redundant or alternative pathways. Thus, only a limited number of genes have been identified to be lethal to the cell. In this regard, the reaction-centric gene deletion study has a limitation in understanding the metabolic robustness. Here, we report the use of flux-sum, which is the summation of all incoming or outgoing fluxes around a particular metabolite under pseudo-steady state conditions, as a good conserved property for elucidating such robustness of E. coli from the metabolite point of view. The functional behavior, as well as the structural and evolutionary properties of metabolites essential to the cell survival, was investigated by means of a constraints-based flux analysis under perturbed conditions. The essential metabolites are capable of maintaining a steady flux-sum even against severe perturbation by actively redistributing the relevant fluxes. Disrupting the flux-sum maintenance was found to suppress cell growth. This approach of analyzing metabolite essentiality provides insight into cellular robustness and concomitant fragility, which can be used for several applications, including the development of new drugs for treating pathogens.},

  issn = {0006-3495},
  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, a sudden increase in external concentration causes a pressure drop across the cell envelope, followed by an active recovery. After recovery, and if the external osmolality remains high, cells have been shown to grow more slowly, smaller, and at reduced turgor pressure. Despite the fact that the active recovery is a key stress response, the nature of these changes and how they relate to each other is not understood. Here, we use fluorescence imaging of single cells during hyperosmotic shocks, combined with custom made microfluidic devices, to show that cells fully recover their volume to the initial, preshock value and continue to grow at a slower rate immediately after the recovery. We show that the cell envelope material properties do not change after hyperosmotic shock, and that cell shape recovers along with cell volume. Taken together, these observations indicate that the turgor pressure recovers to its initial value so that reduced turgor is not responsible for the reduced growth rate observed immediately after recovery. To determine the point at which the reduction in cell size and turgor pressure occurs after shock, we measured the volume of E.~coli cells at different stages of growth in bulk cultures. We show that cell volume reaches the same maximal level irrespective of the osmolality of the media. Based on these measurements, we propose that turgor pressure is used as a feedback variable for osmoregulatory pumps instead of being directly responsible for the reduction in growth rates. Reestablishment of turgor to its initial value might ensure correct attachment of the inner membrane and cell wall needed for cell wall biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {All living cells employ an array of different mechanisms to help them survive changes in extra cellular osmotic pressure. The difference in the concentration of chemicals in a bacterium's cytoplasm and the external environment generates an osmotic pressure that inflates the cell. It is thought that the bacterium Escherichia coli use a number of interconnected systems to adapt to changes in external pressure, allowing them to maintain turgor and live in surroundings that range more than two-hundred-fold in external osmolality. Here, we use fluorescence imaging to make the first measurements of cell volume changes over time during hyperosmotic shock and subsequent adaptation on a single cell level in vivo with a time resolution on the order of seconds. We directly observe two previously unseen phases of the cytoplasmic water efflux upon hyperosmotic shock. Furthermore, we monitor cell volume changes during the post-shock recovery and observe a two-phase response that depends on the shock magnitude. The initial phase of recovery is fast, on the order of 15\textendash{}20 min and shows little cell-to-cell variation. For large sucrose shocks, a secondary phase that lasts several hours adds to the recovery. We find that cells are able to recover fully from shocks as high as 1 Osmol/kg using existing systems, but that for larger shocks, protein synthesis is required for full recovery.},

  abstract = {The basic methodology for designing, altering, and constructing biological systems is increasingly relying on well-established engineering principles to move forward from trial and error approaches to reliably predicting the system behavior from the properties of the components and their interactions. The inherent complexity of even the simplest biological systems, however, often precludes achieving such predictive power. A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups. The reason is the pervasive complex hierarchy of events involved in gene regulation that extend from specific protein\textendash{}DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we integrate such complexity into a few-parameter model to accurately predict gene expression from a few simple rules to connect the parts. The model accurately reproduces the observed transcriptional activity of the lac operon over a 10,000-fold range for 21 different operator setups, different repressor concentrations, and tetrameric and dimeric forms of the repressor. Incorporation of the calibrated model into more complex scenarios accurately captures the induction curves for key operator configurations and the temporal evolution of the {$\beta$}-galactosidase activity of cell populations.},

  abstract = {A canonical quantitative view of transcriptional regulation holds that the only role of operator sequence is to set the probability of transcription factor binding, with operator occupancy determining the level of gene expression. In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

  abstract = {According to recent experimental evidence, promoter architecture, defined by the number, strength and regulatory role of the operators that control transcription, plays a major role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. These quantitative experiments call for a corresponding modeling effort that addresses the question of how changes in promoter architecture affect variability in gene expression in a systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. In this article we make such a systematic investigation, based on a microscopic model of gene regulation that incorporates stochastic effects. In particular, we show how operator strength and operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the level of variability in transcriptional output from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per cell can be used to test kinetic models of gene regulation. The emphasis of the discussion is on prokaryotic gene regulation, but our analysis can be extended to eukaryotic cells as well.},

The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

  abstract = {Expression levels of individual copies of an inducible gene have been presumed to be identical to the averaged level of many copies and to change in a smooth and predictable way according to the concentration of an inducing molecule. However, our recent experiments using a steroid-inducible system showed that the expression levels of individual copies are very heterogeneous and do not necessarily coincide with the averaged expression level of many copies (Ko et al., 1990, EMBO J. 9, 2835\textendash{}2842). To explain this result, I present a stochastic model for gene induction here and its analysis using computer simulation. Stochasticity in the model is derived from the randomness corresponding to the random timing of molecular collisions and dissociations between transcription factors and a gene copy, since at any instant each copy is thought to be either ``switched on'' by having a transcription complex bound to it, or ``switched off' by not having a transcription complex bound. This model can produce two types of gene induction that depend on the stability of the transcription complex on the regulatory region of the gene. An unstable transcription complex causes a homogeneous level of gene induction among individual copies, while a stable transcription complex causes a heterogeneous level. Since the recent consensus formed by in vitro transcription experiments is that the transcription complex is generally very stable, the latter case (the non-deterministic one) is highly possible. Since typical eukaryotic cells have just two copies for any gene in a single cell, this possibility of heterogeneous gene induction indicates that the phenotypes of individual cells cannot be precisely determined by just environmental signals, such as inducers. This may prompt us to reconsider many problems related to gene induction, including morphogenesis.},

Two possible sources of synergy allowing the combinatorial specificity of transcription factors action are compared, for binding to DNA and for recruiting transcription machineries.

In one population, three clones were isolated and by means of reconstruction experiments were shown to be maintained in stable polymorphism, although they exhibited substantial differences in maximum specific growth rates and in glucose uptake kinetics. Analysis of these three clones revealed that their stable coexistence could be explained by differential patterns of the secretion and uptake of two alternative metabolites acetate and glycerol. Regulatory (constitutive and null) mutations in acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase accounted for different patterns of acetate secretion and uptake seen. Altered patterns in glycerol uptake are most likely explained by mutations which result in quantitative differences in the induction of the glycerol regulon and/or structural changes in glycerol kinase that reduce allosteric inhibition by effector molecules associated with glycolysis. The evolution of resource partitioning, and consequent polymorphisms which arise may illustrate incipient processes of speciation in asexual organisms.},

However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of {$\sim$}500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

  abstract = {Binding of genome regulatory proteins to nonspecific DNA sites may play an important role in controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interactions of these proteins with their specific target DNA sequences. An estimate of the fraction of Escherichia coli lac repressor molecules bound in vivo to the operator region and to nonoperator sites on the E. coli chromosome is derived by measurement of the distribution of repressor between a minicell-producing E. coli strain (P678-54) and the DNA-free minicells derived therefrom. Assuming the minicell cytoplasm to be representative of that of the parent E. coli cells, we find that less than 10\% of the repressor tetramers of the average cell are free in solution; the remainder are presumed to be bound to the bacterial chromosome. The minimum in vivo value of the association constant for repressor to bulk nonoperator DNA (KRD) calculated from these results is about 103 M-1, and analysis of the sources of error in the minicell experiment suggests that the actual in vivo value of KRD could be substantially greater. The value of KRD, coupled with in vitro data on the ionic strength dependence of this parameter, can be used to estimate that the effective intracellular cation activity of E. coli is no greater than about 0.24 M (and probably no less than 0.17 M) in terms of sodium ion equivalents. The minicell distribution experiments also confirm that the association constant for the binding of inducer-repressor complex to bulk nonoperator DNA (KRID) is [unk] KRDin vivo. These results are used to calculate minimum in vivo values of KRO and KRIO (association constants for repressor and for inducer-repressor complex binding to operator) of about 1012 M-1 and about 109 M-1, respectively. The results fit a quantitative model for operon regulation in which nonspecific DNA-repressor complexes play a key role in determining basal and constitutive levels of gene expression [von Hippel, P.

In a new environment, however, the same bacteria may grow poorly due to regulatory constraints or biochemical deficiencies. Adaptation to such conditions can proceed through the acquisition of new cellular functionality due to gain of function mutations or via modulation of cellular networks. Using selection experiments on transposon-mutagenized libraries of bacteria, we illustrate that even under conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial adaptation can be achieved solely through loss of function mutations, which rewire the metabolism of the cell without gain of enzymatic or sensory function. A systematic analysis of similar experiments under more than 100 conditions reveals that adaptive loss of function mutations exist for many environmental challenges. Drawing on a wealth of examples from published articles, we detail the range of mechanisms through which loss-of-function mutations can generate such beneficial regulatory changes, without the need for rare, specific mutations to fine-tune enzymatic activities or network connections. The high rate at which loss-of-function mutations occur suggests that null mutations play an underappreciated role in the early stages of adaption of bacterial populations to new environments.},

This novel perspective of gene loss is raising new fundamental questions. How relevant has gene loss been in the divergence of phyla? How do genes change from being essential to dispensable and finally to being lost? Is gene loss mostly neutral, or can it be an effective way of adaptation? These questions are addressed, and insights are discussed from genomic studies of gene loss in populations and their relevance in evolutionary biology and biomedicine.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the factors that determine the rate of adaptation is a major question in evolutionary biology. One key parameter is the effect of a new mutation on fitness, which invariably depends on the environment and genetic background. The fate of a mutation also depends on population size, which determines the amount of drift it will experience. Here, we manipulate both population size and genotype composition and follow adaptation of 23 distinct Escherichia coli genotypes. These have previously accumulated mutations under intense genetic drift and encompass a substantial fitness variation. A simple rule is uncovered: the net fitness change is negatively correlated with the fitness of the genotype in which new mutations appear\textemdash{}a signature of epistasis. We find that Fisher's geometrical model can account for the observed patterns of fitness change and infer the parameters of this model that best fit the data, using Approximate Bayesian Computation. We estimate a genomic mutation rate of 0.01 per generation for fitness altering mutations, albeit with a large confidence interval, a mean fitness effect of mutations of -0.01, and an effective number of traits nine in mutS- E. coli. This framework can be extended to confront a broader range of models with data and test different classes of fitness landscape models.},

These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them. These results provide the first evidence that patterns of epistasis may differ for within- and between-gene interactions during adaptation and that diminishing returns epistasis contributes to the consistent observation of decelerating fitness gains during adaptation.
Interactions between genes reduce the benefits of a mutation and decrease the rate of fitness gain during adaptation.

However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

  shorttitle = {Vibrational {{Entropy}} of a {{Protein}}},
  abstract = {In this article, it is investigated whether vibrational entropy (VE) is an important contribution to the free energy of globular proteins at ambient conditions. VE represents the major configurational-entropy contribution of these proteins. By definition, it is an average of the configurational entropies of the protein within single minima of the energy landscape, weighted by their occupation probabilities. Its large part originates from thermal motion of flexible torsion angles giving rise to the finite peak widths observed in torsion angle distributions. While VE may affect the equilibrium properties of proteins, it is usually neglected in numerical calculations as its consideration is difficult. Moreover, it is sometimes believed that all well-packed conformations of a globular protein have similar VE anyway. Here, we measure explicitly the VE for six different conformations from simulation data of a test protein. Estimates are obtained using the quasi-harmonic approximation for three coordinate sets, Cartesian, bond-angle-torsion (BAT), and a new set termed rotamer-degeneracy lifted BAT coordinates by us. The new set gives improved estimates as it overcomes a known shortcoming of the quasi-harmonic approximation caused by multiply populated rotamer states, and it may serve for VE estimation of macromolecules in a very general context. The obtained VE values depend considerably on the type of coordinates used. However, for all coordinate sets we find large entropy differences between the conformations, of the order of the overall stability of the protein. This result may have important implications on the choice of free energy expressions used in software for protein structure prediction, protein design, and NMR refinement.},

Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ {$\cdot$} mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean.},

However, the precise ecological factors supporting cooperation are still puzzling. Following recent experiments, we consider the role of population growth and the repetitive fragmentation of populations into new colonies mimicking simple microbial life-cycles. Individual-based modeling reveals that demographic fluctuations, which lead to a large variance in the composition of colonies, promote cooperation. Biased by population dynamics these fluctuations result in two qualitatively distinct regimes of robust cooperation under repetitive fragmentation into groups. First, if the level of cooperation exceeds a threshold, cooperators will take over the whole population. Second, cooperators can also emerge from a single mutant leading to a robust coexistence between cooperators and free-riders. We find frequency and size of population bottlenecks, and growth dynamics to be the major ecological factors determining the regimes and thereby the evolutionary pathway towards cooperation.},

In contrast to the common assumption of an independent population size, evolution can be strongly affected by population dynamics in general. Especially for fast reproducing microbes which are subject to selection, both types of dynamics are often closely intertwined. We illustrate this by considering different growth scenarios. Depending on whether microbes die or stop to reproduce (dormancy), qualitatively different behaviors emerge. For cooperating bacteria, a permanent increase of costly cooperation can occur. Even if not permanent, cooperation can still increase transiently due to demographic fluctuations. We validate our analysis via stochastic simulations and analytic calculations. In particular, we derive a condition for an increase in the level of cooperation.},

This correlation is observed in diverse bacteria, revealing a near-constant ratio between nucleoid and cell size for a given species. As in eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio in bacteria varies greatly among species. This spectrum of nucleocytoplasmic ratios is independent of genome size, and instead it appears linked to the average population cell size. Bacteria with different nucleocytoplasmic ratios have a cytoplasm with different biophysical properties, impacting ribosome mobility and localization. Together, our findings identify new organizational principles and biophysical features of bacterial cells, implicating the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and cell size as determinants of the intracellular organization of translation.},

Our approach made use of the unique genomic associations of specific reductive dehalogenase subunit A encoding genes (rdhA) that exist in known strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi and Desulfitobacterium and the distinguishing covariance pattern of observed rdhA genes to assign genes to unknown strains. To test this approach, we operated five anaerobic reductively dechlorinating chemostats for 3\textendash{}4 years with tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene as terminal electron acceptors and lactate/formate as electron donors. The presence and abundance of rdhA genes were determined comprehensively at the community level using a custom-developed Reductive Dehalogenase Chip (RDH Chip) DNA microarray and used to define putative strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi and Desulfitobacterium sp. This monitoring revealed that stable chemical performance of chemostats was reflected by a stable community of reductively dechlorinating bacteria. However, perturbations introduced by, for example, electron donor limitation or addition of the competing electron acceptor sulfate led to overall changes in the chemostat performance, including incomplete reduction in the chloroethene substrates, and in the population composition of reductively dehalogenating bacteria. Interestingly, there was a high diversity of operationally defined D. mccartyi strains between the chemostats with almost all strains unique to their specific chemostats in spite of similar selective pressure and similar inocula shared between chemostats.},

The change in turgor pressure resulting from an osmotic shock alters the mechanical forces within the cell envelope, and can impact cell growth across a range of timescales, through a variety of mechanical mechanisms. Here, we first summarize measurements of turgor pressure in various organisms. We then review how the combination of microfluidic flow cells and quantitative image analysis has driven discovery of the diverse ways in which turgor pressure mechanically regulates bacterial growth, independent of the effect of cytoplasmic crowding. In Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria, reductions in turgor pressure cause decreased growth rate. Moreover, a hypoosmotic shock, which increases turgor pressure and membrane tension, leads to transient inhibition of cell-wall growth via electrical depolarization. By contrast, Gram-negative Escherichia coli is remarkably insensitive to changes in turgor. We discuss the extent to which turgor pressure impacts processes such as cell division that alter cell shape, in particular that turgor facilitates millisecond-scale daughter-cell separation in many Actinobacteria and eukaryotic fission yeast. This diverse set of responses showcases the potential for using osmotic shocks to interrogate how mechanical perturbations affect cellular processes.},

To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.},

  volume = {27},
  issn = {09621083},
  abstract = {Both dispersal limitation and environmental sorting can affect genetic variation in populations, but their contribution remains unclear, particularly in microbes. We sought to determine the contribution of geographic distance (as a proxy for dispersal limitation) and phenotypic traits (as a proxy for environmental sorting), including morphology, metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness, to the genotypic diversity in a nectar yeast species, Metschnikowia reukaufii. To measure genotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes of 102 strains of M. reukaufii isolated from the floral nectar of hummingbird-pollinated shrub, Mimulus aurantiacus, along a 200km coastline in California. Intraspecific genetic variation showed no detectable relationship with geographic distance, but could be grouped into three distinct lineages that correlated with metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness. Despite ample evidence for strong competitive interactions within and among nectar yeasts, a full spectrum of the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed across the 200km coastline was represented even at a scale as small as 200 m. Further, more competitive strains were not necessarily more abundant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation and environmental sorting might not fully explain intraspecific diversity in this microbe and highlight the need to also consider other ecological factors such as trade-offs, source-sink dynamics and niche modification.},

  volume = {100},
  issn = {0006-3495},
  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, ribosomes concentrate near the cylindrical wall and at the endcaps, whereas the chromosomal DNA segregates in the more centrally located nucleoid. A simple statistical model recovers the observed ribosome-nucleoid segregation remarkably well. Plectonemic DNA is represented as a hyperbranched hard-sphere polymer, and multiple ribosomes that simultaneously translate the same mRNA strand (polysomes) are represented as freely jointed chains of hard spheres. There are no attractive interactions between particles, only excluded-volume effects. At realistic DNA and ribosome concentrations, segregation arises primarily from two effects: the DNA polymer avoids walls to maximize conformational entropy, and the polysomes occupy the empty space near the walls to maximize translational entropy. In this complex system, maximizing total entropy results in spatial organization of the components. Due to coupling of mRNA to DNA through RNA polymerase, the same entropic effects should favor the placement of highly expressed genes at the interface between the nucleoid and the ribosome-rich periphery. Such a placement would enable efficient cotranscriptional translation and facile transertion of membrane proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, in the model, monofunctional DNA polymer beads representing the tips of plectonemes preferentially locate near the cylindrical wall. This suggests that initiation of transcription may occur preferentially near the ribosome-rich periphery.},

  abstract = {To break down organismal fitness into molecular contributions, costs and benefits of cellular components must be analyzed in all phases of the organism's life cycle. Here, we establish the required quantitative approach for the death phase of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We show that in carbon starvation, an exponential decay of viability emerges as a collective phenomenon, with viable cells recycling nutrients from cell carcasses to maintain viability. The observed collective death rate is determined by the maintenance rate of viable cells and the amount of nutrients recovered from dead cells. Using this relation, we study the cost of a wasteful enzyme during starvation and the benefit of the stress response sigma factor RpoS. While the enzyme increases maintenance and thereby the death rate, RpoS improves biomass recycling, decreasing the death rate. Our approach thus enables quantitative analyses of how cellular components affect the survival of non-growing cells.},

The growth rate of this strain in either rich or minimal medium varies as a simple function of temperature with an Arrhenius constant of approximately 13,500 cal (ca. 56,500 J) per mol from 23 to 37 degrees C, the so-called normal range; above and below this range the growth rate decreases sharply. Analysis of the detailed results indicates that (i) metabolic coordination within the normal (Arrhenius) range is largely achieved by modulation of enzyme activity rather than amount; (ii) the restricted growth that occurs outside this range is accompanied by marked changes in the levels of most of these proteins; (iii) a few proteins are thermometer-like in varying simply with temperature over the whole temperature range irrespective of the influence of temperature on cell growth; and (iv) the temperature response of half of the proteins can be predicted from current information on their metabolic role or from their variation in level in different media at 37 degrees C.},

Although many studies have focused on the precise mechanism of chromophore maturation, little is known about the kinetics of de novo chromophore maturation. Here we present a simple and efficient method for examining the de novo kinetics. GFP with an immature chromophore was synthesized in a reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system under anaerobic conditions. Chromophore maturation was initiated by rapid dilution in an air-saturated maturation buffer, and the time course of fluorescence development was monitored. Comparison of the de novo maturation rates in various GFP variants revealed that some folding mutations near the chromophore promoted rapid chromophore maturation and that the accumulation of mutations could reduce the maturation rate. Our method will contribute to the design of rapidly maturing fluorescent proteins with improved characteristics for real-time monitoring of cellular events.},

  abstract = {All living cells employ an array of different mechanisms to help them survive changes in extra cellular osmotic pressure. The difference in the concentration of chemicals in a bacterium's cytoplasm and the external environment generates an osmotic pressure that inflates the cell. It is thought that the bacterium Escherichia coli use a number of interconnected systems to adapt to changes in external pressure, allowing them to maintain turgor and live in surroundings that range more than two-hundred-fold in external osmolality. Here, we use fluorescence imaging to make the first measurements of cell volume changes over time during hyperosmotic shock and subsequent adaptation on a single cell level in vivo with a time resolution on the order of seconds. We directly observe two previously unseen phases of the cytoplasmic water efflux upon hyperosmotic shock. Furthermore, we monitor cell volume changes during the post-shock recovery and observe a two-phase response that depends on the shock magnitude. The initial phase of recovery is fast, on the order of 15-20 min and shows little cell-to-cell variation. For large sucrose shocks, a secondary phase that lasts several hours adds to the recovery. We find that cells are able to recover fully from shocks as high as 1 Osmol/kg using existing systems, but that for larger shocks, protein synthesis is required for full recovery.},

  abstract = {Transposon mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) is a powerful approach to annotate gene function in bacteria, but existing protocols for TnSeq require laborious preparation of every sample before sequencing. Thus, the existing protocols are not amenable to the throughput necessary to identify phenotypes and functions for the majority of genes in diverse bacteria. Here, we present a method, random bar code transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq), which increases the throughput of mutant fitness profiling by incorporating random DNA bar codes into Tn5 and mariner transposons and by using bar code sequencing (BarSeq) to assay mutant fitness. RB-TnSeq can be used with any transposon, and TnSeq is performed once per organism instead of once per sample. Each BarSeq assay requires only a simple PCR, and 48 to 96 samples can be sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq system. We demonstrate the reproducibility and biological significance of RB-TnSeq with Escherichia coli, Phaeobacter inhibens, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Shewanella amazonensis, and Shewanella oneidensis. To demonstrate the increased throughput of RB-TnSeq, we performed 387 successful genome-wide mutant fitness assays representing 130 different bacterium-carbon source combinations and identified 5,196 genes with significant phenotypes across the five bacteria. In P. inhibens, we used our mutant fitness data to identify genes important for the utilization of diverse carbon substrates, including a putative d-mannose isomerase that is required for mannitol catabolism. RB-TnSeq will enable the cost-effective functional annotation of diverse bacteria using mutant fitness profiling.
IMPORTANCE A large challenge in microbiology is the functional assessment of the millions of uncharacterized genes identified by genome sequencing. Transposon mutagenesis coupled to next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) is a powerful approach to assign phenotypes and functions to genes. However, the current strategies for TnSeq are too laborious to be applied to hundreds of experimental conditions across multiple bacteria. Here, we describe an approach, random bar code transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq), which greatly simplifies the measurement of gene fitness by using bar code sequencing (BarSeq) to monitor the abundance of mutants. We performed 387 genome-wide fitness assays across five bacteria and identified phenotypes for over 5,000 genes. RB-TnSeq can be applied to diverse bacteria and is a powerful tool to annotate uncharacterized genes using phenotype data.},

Introduction Understanding how bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance grow in the presence of antibiotics is critical for predicting the spread and evolution of drug resistance. Because drugs inhibit cell growth and a cell's growth state globally influences its gene expression, the expression of drug resistance is subject to an innate, growth-mediated feedback, leading to complex behaviors that affect both the characterization and the prevention of antibiotic resistance. We characterized the consequences of this feedback for the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
{$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/342/6162/1237435/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Fitness landscape and growth bistability. (A) This fitness landscape describes the fitness, or growth rates, of bacterial strains exposed to antibiotics (colored lines indicate the fitness of four example strains). Fitness drops abruptly at high drug concentrations. The shaded area shows a broad region of growth bistability, throughout which we observe that genetically identical cells possessing drug resistance are split into subpopulations of growing and nongrowing cells in response to antibiotics (B, top).
Methods We studied the growth of Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics, by using both bulk and single-cell techniques. The growth of each strain was quantified in a broad range of drug concentrations by using time-lapse microscopy (to track the responses of individual cells to antibiotics inside a microfluidic chemostat) and by the enrichment of batch cultures for nongrowing cells. We formulated a quantitative phenomenological model to predict the growth rates of drug-resistant strains in the presence of drugs, based on the well-characterized biochemistry of drug and drug-resistance interactions and on bacterial growth laws that dictate relations between cell growth and gene expression. We tested the model predictions for various drugs and resistance mechanisms by constructing strains that constitutively express varying degrees of drug resistance.
Results In strains expressing a moderate degree of drug resistance, growth rates dropped abruptly above a critical drug concentration, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), whose value increased linearly with the basal level of resistance expression (see figure below, panel A). Cells exhibited growth bistability over a broad range of drug concentrations below the MIC: Isogenic cells expressing drug resistance coexisted in growing and nongrowing states in a homogeneous environment (panel B). Our model accurately predicted the range of drug concentrations in which growth bistability occurred, as well as the growth rates of the growing subpopulation, without any ad hoc fitting parameters. These findings reveal a plateau-like fitness landscape (panel A), which can be used to study the evolution of drug resistance in environments with varying drug concentrations.
Discussion The broad occurrence of growth bistability in drug-resistant bacteria challenges the common notions and measures of drug efficacy and resistance. And because growth bistability can arise without complex regulation when gene expression is coupled to the state of cell growth, similar physiological links may underlie the growth bistability implicated in causing bacterial persistence. The availability of quantitative, predictive models will facilitate the formulation of strategies to limit the efficacy and evolvability of drug resistance.
Keeping Quiet
Many bacteria overcome antibiotic treatment by expressing proteins that confer antibiotic resistance, for instance, efflux pumps. But when a strain that expresses these antibiotic resistance proteins encounters an environment containing the corresponding drug, the resistance against the drug may paradoxically become silenced in many cells. In this case, a fraction of a population of genetically identical cells will grow in the presence of antibiotics while other subpopulations fail to grow at all. Deris et al. (10.1126/science.1237435) show that this bistable response arises from a built-in global feedback originating in antibiotic-mediated inhibition of growth, which reduces the expression of proteins that protect against growth inhibition. The resulting populations of dormant cells can exceed 50\%, among otherwise identical resistance-expressing cells. This is important for antimicrobial treatment strategies because many bacterial cells may remain vulnerable to an antibiotic even when they apparently display strong resistance to it.
To predict the emergence of antibiotic resistance, quantitative relations must be established between the fitness of drug-resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.
Identical bacteria can have low-level resistance to low concentrations of drugs that can flip subpopulations into dormancy.

  abstract = {Many pathogens exist in phenotypically distinct strains that interact with each other through competition for hosts. General models that describe such multi-strain systems are extremely difficult to analyze because their state spaces are enormously large. Reduced models have been proposed, but so far all of them necessarily allow for coinfections and require that immunity be mediated solely by reduced infectivity, a potentially problematic assumption. Here, we suggest a new state-space reduction approach that allows immunity to be mediated by either reduced infectivity or reduced susceptibility and that can naturally be used for models with or without coinfections. Our approach utilizes the general framework of status-based models. The cornerstone of our method is the introduction of immunity variables, which describe multi-strain systems more naturally than the traditional tracking of susceptible and infected hosts. Models expressed in this way can be approximated in a natural way by a truncation method that is akin to moment closure, allowing us to sharply reduce the size of the state space, and thus to consider models with many strains in a tractable manner. Applying our method to the phenomenon of antigenic drift in influenza A, we propose a potentially general mechanism that could constrain viral evolution to a one-dimensional manifold in a two-dimensional trait space. Our framework broadens the class of multi-strain systems that can be adequately described by reduced models. It permits computational, and even analytical, investigation and thus serves as a useful tool for understanding the evolution and ecology of multi-strain pathogens.},

Many characteristics of HA's sequence evolution are captured by standard Markov chain substitution models. Such models assign equal fitness to all accessible amino acids at a site. We show, however, that such models strongly underestimate the number of homoplastic amino acid substitutions during the course of HA's evolution, i.e. substitutions that repeatedly give rise to the same amino acid at a site. We develop statistics to detect individual homoplastic events and find that they preferentially occur at positively selected epitopic sites. Our results suggest that the evolution of the influenza A HA, including evolution by positive selection, is strongly affected by the long-term site-specific preferences for individual amino acids.},

Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS{$>$}1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},

In this situation, we consider the effects of fluctuations stemming from a finite population size. We show that they unavoidably lead to extinction of two strategies in the population. However, the typical time until extinction occurs strongly prolongs with increasing system size. In the emerging time window, a quasi-stationary probability distribution forms that is anomalously flat in the vicinity of the coexistence state. This behavior originates in a vanishing linear deterministic drift near the fixed point. We provide numerical data as well as an analytical approach to the mean extinction time and the quasi-stationary probability distribution.},

Selection by individuals' fitness, usually the basic driving force of evolution, quickly eliminates cooperators. However, evolution is also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness differences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate the effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas.By studying the mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to fluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging `edge of neutral evolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our results reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral regimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory, where defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our studies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to partly resolve social dilemmas.

Because of a sort of mutation buffering process, different starting mutations can tend to end up with similar overall affects on an organism's fitness. Kryazhimskiy et al. evolved lines of yeast, each originating from distinct single genotypes, under the same selective regimen. A subset of clones from these adapted populations was subjected to fitness assays and sequenced. Populations with lower initial fitness, adapted more rapidly than populations with higher initial fitness, so that in the end the fitness levels were similar.
Science, this issue p. 1519
Epistatic interactions between mutations can make evolutionary trajectories contingent on the chance occurrence of initial mutations. We used experimental evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quantify this contingency, finding differences in adaptability among 64 closely related genotypes. Despite these differences, sequencing of 104 evolved clones showed that initial genotype did not constrain future mutational trajectories. Instead, reconstructed combinations of mutations revealed a pattern of diminishing-returns epistasis: Beneficial mutations have consistently smaller effects in fitter backgrounds. Taken together, these results show that beneficial mutations affecting a variety of biological processes are globally coupled; they interact strongly, but only through their combined effect on fitness. As a consequence, fitness evolution follows a predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation is stochastic.
Epistasis makes fitness trajectories unpredictable in yeast, even as they converge upon the same biological pathway.

This genetic variation in adaptability and pleiotropy is largely determined by initial fitness, according to a rule of declining adaptability with increasing initial fitness, but several individual QTLs also have a significant idiosyncratic role.

  abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing has become an indispensible tool of modern biology. However, the cost of sample preparation relative to the cost of sequencing remains high, especially for small genomes where the former is dominant. Here we present a protocol for rapid and inexpensive preparation of hundreds of multiplexed genomic libraries for Illumina sequencing. By carrying out the Nextera tagmentation reaction in small volumes, replacing costly reagents with cheaper equivalents, and omitting unnecessary steps, we achieve a cost of library preparation of \$8 per sample, approximately 6 times cheaper than the standard Nextera XT protocol. Furthermore, our procedure takes less than 5 hours for 96 samples. Several hundred samples can then be pooled on the same HiSeq lane via custom barcodes. Our method will be useful for re-sequencing of microbial or viral genomes, including those from evolution experiments, genetic screens, and environmental samples, as well as for other sequencing applications including large amplicon, open chromosome, artificial chromosomes, and RNA sequencing.},

  abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has provided a myriad of applications for biological systems1. Over the last several years, mutagenesis studies have improved folding properties of GFP (refs 1,2). However, slow maturation is still a big obstacle to the use of GFP variants for visualization. These problems are exacerbated when GFP variants are expressed at 37\textdegree{}C and/or targeted to certain organelles. Thus, obtaining GFP variants that mature more efficiently is crucial for the development of expanded research applications. Among Aequorea GFP variants, yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are relatively acid-sensitive, and uniquely quenched by chloride ion (Cl-)3. For YFP to be fully and stably fluorescent, mutations that decrease the sensitivity to both pH and Cl- are desired. Here we describe the development of an improved version of YFP named ``Venus''. Venus contains a novel mutation, F46L, which at 37\textdegree{}C greatly accelerates oxidation of the chromophore, the rate-limiting step of maturation. As a result of other mutations, F64L/M153T/V163A/S175G, Venus folds well and is relatively tolerant of exposure to acidosis and Cl-. We succeeded in efficiently targeting a neuropeptide Y-Venus fusion protein to the dense-core granules of PC12 cells. Its secretion was readily monitored by measuring release of fluorescence into the medium. The use of Venus as an acceptor allowed early detection of reliable signals of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for Ca2+ measurements in brain slices. With the improved speed and efficiency of maturation and the increased resistance to environment, Venus will enable fluorescent labelings that were not possible before.},

The vast quantity of data collected in high-throughput experiments requires a fast and reliable automated method to analyze fluorescence intensity and localization, cell morphology and proliferation as well as other descriptors. Inspired by effective yet tractable methods of population-level analysis using flow cytometry, we have developed a framework and tools for facilitating analogous analyses in image cytometry. These tools can both visualize and gate (generate subpopulations) more than 70 cell descriptors, including cell size, age and fluorescence. The method is well suited to multi-well imaging, analysis of bacterial cultures with high cell density (thousands of cells per frame) and complete cell cycle imaging. We give a brief description of the analysis of four distinct applications to emphasize the broad applicability of the tool.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Theory predicts rapid genetic drift in expanding populations due to the serial founder effect at the expansion front. Yet, many natural populations maintain high genetic diversity in the newly colonized regions. Here, we investigate whether density-dependent dispersal could provide a resolution of this paradox. We find that genetic drift is dramatically suppressed when dispersal rates increase with the population density because many more migrants from the diverse, high-density regions arrive at the expansion edge. When density-dependence is weak or negative, the effective population size of the front scales only logarithmically with the carrying capacity. The dependence, however, switches to a sublinear power law and then to a linear increase as the density-dependence becomes strongly positive. To understand these results, we introduce a unified framework that predicts how the strength of genetic drift depends on the density-dependence in both dispersal and growth. This theory reveals that the transitions between different regimes of diversity loss are controlled by a single, universal parameter: the ratio of the expansion velocity to the geometric mean of dispersal and growth rates at expansion edge. Importantly, our results suggest that positive density-dependence could dramatically alter evolution in expanding populations even when its contributions to the expansion velocity is small.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Expression of un-utilized protein (that have no benefits in the current environment) incurs a quantifiable fitness costs on cellular growth rates; however, the magnitude and variability of un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown, largely due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome utilization. We address this challenge using absolute and global proteomics data combined with a recently developed genome-scale model of Escherichia coli that computes the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains {$>$}95\% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein expression is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Classification of the unused protein reveals that the unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Thus, unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The intimate relationship between the environment and cellular growth rate has remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a century. Now, as it becomes possible to understand how the growth rate dictates the wholesale reorganization of the intracellular molecular composition, we can interrogate the biophysical principles underlying this adaptive response. Regulation of gene expression drives this adaptation, with changes in growth rate tied to the activation or repression of genes covering enormous swaths of the genome. Here, we dissect how physiological perturbations alter the expression of a circuit which has been extensively characterized in a single physiological state. Given a complete thermodynamic model, we map changes in physiology directly to the biophysical parameters which define the expression. Controlling the growth rate via modulating the available carbon source or growth temperature, we measure the level of gene expression from a LacI-regulated promoter where the LacI copy number is directly measured in each condition, permitting parameter-free prediction of the expression level. The transcriptional output of this circuit is remarkably robust, with expression of the repressor being largely insensitive to the growth rate. The predicted gene expression quantitatively captures the observations under different carbon conditions, indicating that the biophysical parameters are indifferent to the physiology. Interestingly, temperature controls the expression level in ways that are inconsistent with the prediction, revealing temperature-dependent effects that challenge current models. This work exposes the strengths and weaknesses of thermodynamic models in fluctuating environments, posing novel challenges and utility in studying physiological adaptation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
