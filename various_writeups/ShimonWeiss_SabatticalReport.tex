One of the most fundamental aspects of biological inquiry is the relationship
between the sequence of the genome and the physiology of the organism. While we
are still trying to understand the sequence-structure-function relationship of
the genome, there is still much to be understood about how genomes are built and
organized. Whether by viral infection, conjugative transfer, or direct uptake of DNA
through transformation (Fig \ref{fig:hgt_overview} A), bacteria frequently share their genetic material with
their neighbors (including those of different species) influencing the
architecture of the recipients' genome. How this horizontal transfer
of genetic information has influenced their evolution, however, remains enigmatic.

Using some
clever tricks of molecular biology, we have engineered a system that allows for
sequence specific visualization of DNA molecules \textit{in vivo}. Our system
exploits the ParBS plasmid partitioning system to allow for the subcellular
localization and detection of plasmids in living cells without relying on a
secondary reporter associated with the plasmid of interest (Fig 1 B).
Fluorescently labeled ParB molecules are constitutively expressed in the cells
of interest. Upon the uptake of DNA containing a \textit{parS} sequence, ParB
specifically binds and quickly oligomerizes allowing for a large number of ParB
molecules to be concentrated over a short stretch of DNA forming a fluorescent
puncta within the cell. The association
between ParB and \textit{parS} is rapid  and allows for instantaneous
measurement of the uptake of DNA.

This system has been successfully employed in \textit{E. coli} (Fig 1 C) and studies
are currently underway to study replication and segregation of plasmids in
dividing cells as well as the frequency of phage transduction and it's
dependence on location in the genome. Over the past several months, much work
has been done to observe the uptake of DNA through electroporation. 


While ubiquitous in the biology wet lab, 

Talk about how shitty CFUs are.
