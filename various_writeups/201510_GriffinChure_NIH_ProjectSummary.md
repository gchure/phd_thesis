   One of the most fundamental aspects of biological inquiry is the relationship
between the sequence of the genome and the physiology of the organism. While
there is extensive investigation into the sequence-structure-function
relationship of the genome, there is still much to be understood regarding how
genomes are constructed and organized. Whether by viral infection, conjugative
transfer, or the direct uptake of DNA through transformation, bacteria
frequently share their genetic material with their neighbors (including those of
different species) influencing the architecture of the recipients' genome. How
this horizontal transfer of genetic information has influenced their evolution,
however, remains enigmatic. A vast majority of studies focusing on the frequency
and efficiency of HGT in microbes are performed in bulk -- often involving
cultures grown to saturation and measuring the success of HGT by counting
"colony forming units" (CFU). This  leaves many aspects of what happens at the
cellular level unanswered, however, as CFU serves a merely and approximation of
cell number. In addition, microbial populations are often far from saturation in
natural environments, and thrive as structured, non-homogeneous mixtures known
as biofilms. The disparity in physiological relevance between the lab bench and
the real-world calls for single-cell and single-molecule techniques to study the
dynamics and evolutionary consequences of HGT. 

   The gram-positive bacterium *Bacillus subtilis* is famous for its ability to
differentiate under exposure to nutritional or environmental stresses. When
faced with such physiological pressures, *B. subtilis* can either differentiate
into incredibly robust dormant endospores through sporulation or they can enter
a state of 'genetic competence' in which DNA replication and restriction enzyme
synthesis is repressed, recombinases are expressed, and a large transmembrane
protein structure called a competence pilus is assembled which actively
transports DNA into the cell. The machinery and genetic circuitry that regulates
the entry and exit from this fascinating competence state is very well
understood and is easily controlled through the use of standard molecular biology
tools.

   Using *B. subtilis* strains in which competence can be induced by addition of
IPTG to the growth medium, we have measured the frequency of transformation
under varying DNA concentrations as well as growth conditions. Briefly, cells
that have been induced into competence are incubated with a YFP encoding plasmid
which has homology to the host chromosome. Once given time for the expressed
fluorophores to mature, a small aliquot of cells are immobilized on an agarose
substrate and imaged under high magnification with epifluorescence microscopes.
Nearly all cells in a field of view are segmented computationally and have their
fluorescence quantified. Transformants are identified as those cells whose
fluorescence is much greater than the autofluorescent control. We have explored
transformation frequency over a range of 10 to 10^5^ plasmids / cell and with
different growth conditions.

   As mentioned above, environmental conditions influence entry to competence in the
WT system. While our genetically modified system allows comptence to be
controlled through induction, it is unknown whether environmental and
nutritional stresses induce other physiological process which promote or hinder
DNA uptake and genomic recombination. To test if growth conditions influence
the transformation freuqency of comptent cells, we performed the above
experiment with cells grown in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Preliminary
results suggest that at 'low' DNA concentrations (10^1^ -
10^3^ plasmids / cell) there is little difference in frequency.
However, at high DNA concentrations (10^4^ -- 10^5^ plasmids /
cell), the difference is large with approximately 95% and 60% transformation
frequencies for aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions respectively. While
confirmation of these preliminary results are underway, it is interesting to the
effect of growth conditions is an interesting result. Experiments modulating
nutritional stresses, such as using different or limited carbon sources, are
currently underway. 

   While the condition in which cells are grown appears to play a role in
determining transformation frequency, it is surprising that such a high
concentration of DNA is needed to see transformation frequencies above 10%. Is
this transforming fraction of the population more prone to DNA uptake than their
counter parts? We are examining this aspect by using two populations of
plasmids encoding different fluorophore reporters. By measuring the
frequency of double transformation, we will be able to further investigate the
statistical nature of transformation.
