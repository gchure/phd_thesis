\abstract{Many species of plants rely on the metabolic action of soil microbiota
to convert atmospheric dinitrogen into fixed ammonia. In return, some species of
plants, especially the legumes, house these microbes in complicated structures
known as root nodules. Within the root nodules, specific species of bacteria are
internalized into the legume cytoplasm and form stable pseudo-organelles known
as the symbiosome. Both plant and bacterial proteins are found within the
symbiosome membrane suggesting extensive communication between the microbes and
the plant cell. XXXXXXXXX Something about methods XXXXXXX}
