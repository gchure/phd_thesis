\section*{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Brief overview of disparity between the microbes we can culture and the microbes in the environment.
	\item Problem with diversity inflation because of errors in PCR and sequencing. Making it seem tthat there are more microbes present in environments than there really are. 
	\item Being able to culture these microbes deals with that issue partially. We can learn about the system by dissecting it.
	\item Use this culturability to infer likely metabolic processes in environments.

\end{itemize}
\section*{Experimental approach}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use these experimental tools in extreme environments, such as hot springs and arid deserts, to economically important regions, such as forest floor detritus for cellulose digestion.
\end{itemize}<++>
