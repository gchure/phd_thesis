\subsection*{Characterization of Vault Protein Complexes}
\subsection*{Hunt for uncluturable life in extreme environments and the Origin
of Life} 
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item MS for small organic molecules.
		\item Experimental dissection of self-replicating molecules	
		\item CryoEM of extreme environment soil samples.  
		\item Important for astrobiology and understanding pre-biotic evolution.  
		\item Extreme environments include high-saline lakes, deserts, acidic streams, geothermal areas, below freezing areas.
		\item Origin of homochirality -- tracking abundance of D amino
			acids in microbe rich and devoid environments.
